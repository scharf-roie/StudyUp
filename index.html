        <h2>Why StudyUp?</h2>
        <p class="signup-desc">As students know, college can be a challenging time mentally and academically. To be successful, students need a strong social network of friends they can both have fun and develop with. Unfortunately, modern social media can often builds superfluous, distant relationships, driving us apart more than it connects us. For college students, StudyUp is designed to bridge the gap from the online world to real, in-person relationships to improve mental health, academic performance,a nd the general college experience. So what are you waiting for? It’s time to StudyUp.</p>
